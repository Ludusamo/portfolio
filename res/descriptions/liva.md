This system was created by 5 students as a response to the NASA EPIC Challenge.

The beginning of the problem is the desire to mine asteroids for resources such
as metals. More specifically, the system was designed to detect water content
in asteroids. This system was created to solve the problem of determining
potential water content in asteroids.

This system determines potential water content based on magnetic permeability
of a given asteroid. A correlation can be drawn between the magnetic
permeability and the water content of an asteroid. As such, the system has
Magnetic Permeability Assesment Units (MPAUs) that can be cheaply launched at
asteroids to gain readings of the magnetic permeability. The MPAU then sends
the data wirelessly back to a receiver. This receiver then processes the
information to determine potential water content. A visual application was
constructed using Java and interfaced with the Arduino through a COM port.
Data visualization was done through this application.
