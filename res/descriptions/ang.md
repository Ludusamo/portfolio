Long term hobby of making a programming language.

I began getting interested in compilers and programming language design back in
2015 and have been slowly reading and building skills to make my own language.

The first attempts and playing around can be seen here in my
[Toy Language](https://github.com/Ludusamo/ToyLanguage) repository on Github.
The project was originally in C++ and then rewritten over to C.

The latest incarnation of the language has materialized into Angstrom Lang. It
has a new Github repository [here](https://github.com/Ludusamo/angstrom) and
will hopefully be better now that I have learned a lot more. Follow along with
the development as more will soon be coming!
